### About me
I am web designer/developer. I have 5 year experience in web development industry, in this period you can learn about this business, project management, product owners and stakeholders, their requirements; product identity; users needs, their problems, feedbacks and so much more. I have some ideas for future, creating online services in the entertaiment field, I'm so into visuals, and look forward studying abroad in visual communication and interactive design courses, maybe in Germany, because there education is free))) Nonetheless, my main goal is become movie director, screenwriter, maybe even actor)) So if you have great visual experience just let me know! Oh, yeah, I almost forgot, I am freaking lazy and shy guy.

### Hard Skills
Soo, my hard skills; there's not that much
Languages (I guess): HTML (semantics - tags, attributes, h tag sequence, accessibility - aria attributes, tab-indexes, navigation), CSS (SCSS, grid, custom variables, media queries, BEM and OSCSS, a little Atom), JavaScript (Jquery - hated)
Frameworks: Vuejs, Bootstrap
Also know: Gulp and tons of npm plugins

### The code you need
```js
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
```
### The code I love
```js
// algorithm for dating
let me = new Person("boy");
let you = new Person("girl");
if (me.girlFriend === null && me.crushOn(you)) {
  try {
    if (me.askGirlOut(you) == "ok") {
      me.happy = true;
    } else {
      me.cry();
    }
  } catch(IAlreadyHaveABoyFriendException) {
    me.cry();
  }
}
```
### My experience
Since 2017, I've done variety types of web front-end jobs, and learnt how to deal with **responsive markup and styling**, **accessibility**, **semantics**, using and maintaining **frameworks like bootstrap**. 

After certain experience in markup, started handle markup of middle projects, that gave me the skill thinking big picture, understanding ***goals*** and ***purposes of projects***, ***user flow*** and more. 

Starting from 2020, for 2 years I learnt web design, **user experience**, have read popular books like *"Don't make me think"*,*"The design of everyday things"*, *"101 Design principles"* and lots of articles throughout the internet. As a designer by myself done about 6-7 projects, **mobile design** included. One of my works I'm proud of is design of startup project **E-pos and store management system "Quramiz"** supported and financed by one of the biggest Bank in Uzbekistan. 

Scince last year I dug deeper into web front-end, to be more specific learnt **VUE.js** framework and had done my first **big** project late fall in 2022, now in winter of that year I can consider myself as a junior VUE.js developer. I've learnt lot about **single page applications**, principles and purposes of **components**, manipulating data by **store management** plugins, **fetching data** from outside, managing **routes**, handling **errors**, sending and handling data though components, **authorization** and so much more

Alright, I guess enough talking, let's see **code**:

### Education
I've graduated **Tashkent University of Information Technologies** in 2020. Have bachelor degree in computer engineering.
Passed some online video courses, but don't have any certificate because it was free (pirated ><)

### English
I don't have any certificate, some online platforms says that I'm intermediate/upper-intermediate, so...
For the record, I can watch and understand video courses, tv series, comedy shows, news, football matches in english without subtitle. My favourite sitcom is "The office", but I think best sitcom goes to... ofcourse, whithout any doubt, loved by millions of people - "Friends"
