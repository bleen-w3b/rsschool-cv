<h3 id="my-experience">My experience</h3>
<p>Since 2017, I&#39;ve done variety types of web front-end jobs, and learnt how to deal with <strong>responsive markup and styling</strong>, <strong>accessibility</strong>, <strong>semantics</strong>, using and maintaining <strong>frameworks like bootstrap</strong>. </p>
<p>After certain experience in markup, started handle markup of middle projects, that gave me the skill thinking big picture, understanding <strong><em>goals</em></strong> and <strong><em>purposes of projects</em></strong>, <strong><em>user flow</em></strong> and more. </p>
<p>Starting from 2020, for 2 years I learnt web design, <strong>user experience</strong>, have read popular books like <em>&quot;Don&#39;t make me think&quot;</em>,<em>&quot;The design of everyday things&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;101 Design principles&quot;</em> and lots of articles throughout the internet. As a designer by myself done about 6-7 projects, <strong>mobile design</strong> included. One of my works I&#39;m proud of is design of startup project <strong>E-pos and store management system &quot;Quramiz&quot;</strong> supported and financed by one of the biggest Bank in Uzbekistan. </p>
<p>Scince last year I dug deeper into web front-end, to be more specific learnt <strong>VUE.js</strong> framework and had done my first <strong>big</strong> project late fall in 2022, now in winter of that year I can consider myself as a junior VUE.js developer. I&#39;ve learnt lot about <strong>single page applications</strong>, principles and purposes of <strong>components</strong>, manipulating data by <strong>store management</strong> plugins, <strong>fetching data</strong> from outside, managing <strong>routes</strong>, handling <strong>errors</strong>, sending and handling data though components, <strong>authorization</strong> and so much more</p>
<p>Alright, I guess enough talking, let&#39;s see <strong>code</strong>: </p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve graduated <strong>Tashkent University of Information Technologies</strong> in 2020. Have bachelor degree in computer engineering.
Passed some online video courses, but don&#39;t have any certificate because it was free (pirated &gt;&lt;)</p>
<h3 id="english">English</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t have any certificate, some online platforms says that I&#39;m <strong>intermediate/upper-intermediate</strong>, so...</p>
<p>For the record, I can watch and understand video courses, tv series, comedy shows, news, football matches in english without subtitle. </p>
<p>My favourite sitcom is &quot;The office&quot;, but I think best sitcom goes to... ofcourse, whithout any doubt, loved by millions of people - &quot;Friends&quot;</p>
